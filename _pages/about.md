We are a research group led by [Daniel E. Hurtado](). We focus on modeling human pathophysiology in order to advance medicinal practices and knowledge. Our house is the [Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering]() in [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile], which belongs simultaneously to the [Faculty of Engineering](), the [Faculty of Medicine]() and the [Faculty of Biological Sciences]().

Check out our current [projects]() to see what we're working on, and don't hesitate to contact us through email or our socials below.
