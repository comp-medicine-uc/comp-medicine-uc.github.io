We are a research group led by [Daniel E. Hurtado](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Hurtado-4). We focus on modeling human pathophysiology in order to advance medicinal practices and knowledge. Our house is the [Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering](https://ingenieriabiologicaymedica.uc.cl/en/) in [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/en), which belongs simultaneously to the [Faculty of Engineering](https://www.ing.uc.cl/en/), the [Faculty of Medicine](https://medicina.uc.cl/) and the [Faculty of Biological Sciences](https://biologia.uc.cl/).

Check out our [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NwCxlWoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and current [projects](https://comp-medicine-uc.github.io/projects/).
